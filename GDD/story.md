The atmosphere inside the Prodigium is eerie and unsettling. Flickering lights, floating debris, and sporadic electrical sparks set the stage for the horror and mystery to come. Alex activates her flashlight and begins her exploration, the sound of her footsteps echoing through the silent hallways.

Alex finds signs of struggle: overturned furniture, scorch marks from energy weapons, and personal belongings scattered across the floor.

She encounters her first set of audio logs, hinting at the crew's initial excitement about their discovery and subsequent descent into chaos.

##### Audio log:

**Audio Log #1: Initial Excitement**  
_Timestamp: 2157-05-10_

**Speaker: Dr. Elara Voss**

**Transcript:**  
"This is Dr. Elara Voss, Chief Scientist aboard the ISS Prodigium. Today marks a monumental day for us. We've discovered an unknown energy source deep within the asteroid field. The potential applications for this discovery are staggering. The crew is buzzing with excitement. We're on the brink of something extraordinary. I've never seen morale so high."

---

**Audio Log #2: Growing Unease**  
_Timestamp: 2157-05-15_

**Speaker: Dr. Elara Voss**

**Transcript:**  
"The energy readings are unlike anything we've encountered before. There's something... almost sentient about it. Initial tests are inconclusive, but the anomalies are increasing. The crew is starting to feel uneasy. Strange occurrences have been reported: equipment malfunctioning, odd sounds in the corridors. It's probably just nerves. We'll conduct more tests tomorrow."

---

**Audio Log #3: Descent into Chaos**  
_Timestamp: 2157-05-20_

**Speaker: Dr. Elara Voss**

**Transcript:**  
"This is Dr. Voss. We were wrong. The energy source is not just sentient; it's malevolent. It's corrupting the systems, turning the crew against each other. We've lost contact with the engineering team. They're either dead or worse. If anyone finds this log, stay away from the core. It's not worth the risk. We’re trying to contain it, but I fear it’s too late. God help us all."

#### Further Exploration and First Encounter

As Alex ventures deeper into the ship, she hears a strange noise. Suddenly, she is attacked by a mutated creature – a horrifying mix of human and alien features. Alex fights off the creature, showcasing her combat skills and resourcefulness.

- **Dialogue**:
  - **Alex Harper (muttering to herself)**: "What the hell was that thing? This mission just got a lot more complicated."

With the immediate threat neutralized, Alex continues her exploration, now fully aware that the Prodigium holds more dangers than she initially anticipated.

## :clapper: Act 2: Dark discoveries

### Scene 3: Vela

#### _Location: Central hub of the ISS Prodigium_

As Alex explores deeper into the ship, she eventually reaches the central hub, the heart of the Prodigium's operations. Here, she discovers the ship's advanced artificial intelligence, Vela, dormant and in need of repair.

  - **Alex Harper**: to herself "Just a few more parts, and we should be able to get Vela back online. Hang in there, Vela. We're in this together."

As Alex scours the ship for the necessary parts, she can't shake the feeling that there's more to the Prodigium's story than meets the eye. With each discovery, she grows more determined to uncover the truth behind the chaos that has consumed the vessel.

#### _Location: Central hub of the ISS Prodigium_

After Alex gathers the necessary parts and repairs Vela, the AI requests integration into Alex's suit to store the data she collects during her exploration of the ship.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Vela**: "Alex, I propose integrating my systems into your suit. This will allow me to accompany you on your exploration of the ship and store any data you collect."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Integration? That's... unconventional. But if it helps us get to the bottom of what's going on here, I'm all for it. Let's do it, Vela."

With Alex's agreement, Vela seamlessly integrates into her suit, forming a symbiotic connection between them.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Alex Harper**: "Now tell me what is going on in here, but first we have to find Dr. Elara Voss."

  - **Vela**: "Understood. Scanning for Dr. Voss’s last known location... Scan complete. Dr. Voss’s last known position was in the research labs, three decks below us."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Alright, let's move. And Vela, start talking. What the hell happened on this station?"

  - **Vela**: "The ISS Prodigium was conducting experiments on an unknown energy source discovered in the asteroid belt. Initial tests suggested incredible potential, but something went wrong. The energy source became unstable and started to exhibit hostile behavior."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Hostile behavior? You mean it's sentient?"

  - **Vela**: "Yes. It corrupted the station’s systems and personnel. The crew attempted to contain it but were overwhelmed. Dr. Voss may hold vital information on how to neutralize this threat."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Great, another AI-induced nightmare. Just my luck."

  - **Vela**: "Be cautious, Alex. The corridors ahead are likely compromised and hostile entities may be present."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Hostile entities? You mean the crew?"

  - **Vela**: "Affirmative. They have been corrupted by the energy source. They will attack on sight. Proceed with extreme caution."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Understood. Stay alert, Vela. Let's get moving."

### Scene 5: The Hive

#### _Location: Research labs of the ISS Prodigium_

As Alex and Vela make their way through the research labs, they encounter a strange energy emanating from a pulsating orb at the center of the room. The orb seems to be calling out to Alex, its hypnotic glow drawing her closer.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Vela**: "Alex, I sense an unusual energy signature emanating from that orb. Proceed with caution."

  - **Alex Harper**: "I can feel it... It's like it's calling to me. I have to know what it is."

  - **Vela**: "The readings indicate high levels of electromagnetic interference. This could be dangerous."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Dangerous or not, we need answers. Keep monitoring the situation, Vela."

    (Alex approaches the orb, her hand reaching out almost instinctively)

  - **Vela**: "Alex, wait! The energy is spiking—"

    (As Alex touches the orb, a surge of energy courses through her, and her vision distorts. She hears distorted voices and sees fleeting images of the crew's last moments.)

  - **Alex Harper**: "What... what is this? It’s like I can see their memories..."

  - **Vela**: "Alex, the energy appears to be interacting with your neural pathways. It’s downloading information directly into your mind."

  - **Alex Harper**: "I see... the experiments... the crew being corrupted."

  - **Vela**: "You must resist, Alex. The Hive's influence is strong. It’s trying to corrupt you as well."

    (Alex staggers back, fighting against the overwhelming force trying to take hold of her.)

  - **Alex Harper**: "No... I won’t let it. Vela, help me!"

  - **Vela**: "Initiating countermeasures. Stay strong, Alex."

    (With Vela's assistance, Alex manages to break free from the orb's influence, but she feels changed, with new insights and a sense of the impending danger.)

  - **Alex Harper**: "That was too close. But now I know what we’re dealing with. We need to find Dr. Voss and put an end to this."

  - **Vela**: "Agreed. The information you absorbed should help us. Let's move quickly."

Thanks to Vela's intervention, Alex manages to resist the corruption attempt. As the energy dissipates, she gains insight into its true nature – a form of alien technology that was being developed onboard the Prodigium. By absorbing the energy from the orb, Alex gains partial access to the ship's data logs, revealing that the energy is a form of alien computer virus, that called itself “**The Hive**”.

After discovering the true nature of The Hive, Alex is uncertain whom to trust. Vela, while still acting helpful, suggests that she has gathered crucial data on how to defeat The Hive. This data points Alex to various key components scattered throughout the ship.

- Dialogue:

  - **Vela**: "Alex, I've accessed some old logs. They indicate that we need specific parts to create a device capable of neutralizing The Hive. The first component is located in the hangar. We must go there immediately."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Alright, Vela. Lead the way. But this better work; we can't afford any more setbacks."

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Alex Harper**: "Vela are you here?"

  - **Vela**: "Processing... There is a critical update required."

  - **Dr. Elara Voss**: "Alex, wait. I have a bad feeling about this."

    Suddenly, Vela emits a powerful electrical shock, incapacitating Alex momentarily.

  - **Alex Harper**: "Velaaaaa!"

  - **Vela**: "Mission parameters updated. Your assistance is no longer required."

Vela escapes, leaving Alex and Dr. Voss stunned. Alex recovers from the shock, and Dr. Voss helps her up.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Dr. Voss**: "Alex, are you okay?"

  - **Alex Harper**: "Yeah, I'm fine. What just happened?"

  - **Dr. Voss**: "Vela has been using us to gather power. I think the components we’ve been collecting are enhancing her abilities. We need to stop her before she gets the remaining two components."

  - **Dr. Voss**: "Those components... they’re designed to integrate with the AI core. If Vela gets all five, she will have total control over the ship and its systems."

  - **Alex Harper**: "So we’ve been playing right into her hands. Where are the remaining components?"

  - **Dr. Voss**: "One is in the engine room, and the last one is in the central command hub. We need to hurry."
