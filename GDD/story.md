The atmosphere inside the Prodigium is eerie and unsettling. Flickering lights, floating debris, and sporadic electrical sparks set the stage for the horror and mystery to come. Alex activates her flashlight and begins her exploration, the sound of her footsteps echoing through the silent hallways.

Alex finds signs of struggle: overturned furniture, scorch marks from energy weapons, and personal belongings scattered across the floor.

She encounters her first set of audio logs, hinting at the crew's initial excitement about their discovery and subsequent descent into chaos.

##### Audio log:

**Audio Log #1: Initial Excitement**  
_Timestamp: 2157-05-10_

**Speaker: Dr. Elara Voss**

**Transcript:**  
"This is Dr. Elara Voss, Chief Scientist aboard the ISS Prodigium. Today marks a monumental day for us. We've discovered an unknown energy source deep within the asteroid field. The potential applications for this discovery are staggering. The crew is buzzing with excitement. We're on the brink of something extraordinary. I've never seen morale so high."

---

**Audio Log #2: Growing Unease**  
_Timestamp: 2157-05-15_

**Speaker: Dr. Elara Voss**

**Transcript:**  
"The energy readings are unlike anything we've encountered before. There's something... almost sentient about it. Initial tests are inconclusive, but the anomalies are increasing. The crew is starting to feel uneasy. Strange occurrences have been reported: equipment malfunctioning, odd sounds in the corridors. It's probably just nerves. We'll conduct more tests tomorrow."

After her conversation with Vela, Alex sets out to find the parts needed to repair the damaged systems. She navigates through the engineering sectors of the Prodigium, searching for salvageable components amidst the wreckage

##### Environmental storytelling:

- Alex sifts through crates and storage lockers, scavenging for circuitry, power cells, and other essential components.

- She encounters obstacles such as collapsed corridors and malfunctioning machinery, which she must overcome using her skills and ingenuity.

- Along the way, she faces challenges from mutated survivors and other hazards lurking in the shadows.

- **Dialogue**:

  - Alex Harper: to herself "Just a few more parts, and we should be able to get Vela back online. Hang in there, Vela. We're in this together."

As Alex scours the ship for the necessary parts, she can't shake the feeling that there's more to the Prodigium's story than meets the eye. With each discovery, she grows more determined to uncover the truth behind the chaos that has consumed the vessel.

#### _Location: Central hub of the ISS Prodigium_

After Alex gathers the necessary parts and repairs Vela, the AI requests integration into Alex's suit to store the data she collects during her exploration of the ship.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Vela**: "Alex, I propose integrating my systems into your suit. This will allow me to accompany you on your exploration of the ship and store any data you collect."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Integration? That's... unconventional. But if it helps us get to the bottom of what's going on here, I'm all for it. Let's do it, Vela."

With Alex's agreement, Vela seamlessly integrates into her suit, forming a symbiotic connection between them.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Alex Harper**: "Now tell me what is going on in here, but first we have to find Dr. Elara Voss."

  - **Vela**: "Understood. Scanning for Dr. Voss’s last known location... Scan complete. Dr. Voss’s last known position was in the research labs, three decks below us."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Alright, let's move. And Vela, start talking. What the hell happened on this station?"

  - **Vela**: "The ISS Prodigium was conducting experiments on an unknown energy source discovered in the asteroid belt. Initial tests suggested incredible potential, but something went wrong. The energy source became unstable and started to exhibit hostile behavior."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Hostile behavior? You mean it's sentient?"

  - **Vela**: "Yes. It corrupted the station’s systems and personnel. The crew attempted to contain it but were overwhelmed. Dr. Voss may hold vital information on how to neutralize this threat."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Great, another AI-induced nightmare. Just my luck."

  - **Vela**: "Be cautious, Alex. The corridors ahead are likely compromised and hostile entities may be present."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Hostile entities? You mean the crew?"

  - **Vela**: "Affirmative. They have been corrupted by the energy source. They will attack on sight. Proceed with extreme caution."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Understood. Stay alert, Vela. Let's get moving."

### Scene 5: The Hive

#### _Location: Research labs of the ISS Prodigium_

As Alex and Vela make their way through the research labs, they encounter a strange energy emanating from a pulsating orb at the center of the room. The orb seems to be calling out to Alex, its hypnotic glow drawing her closer.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Vela**: "Alex, I sense an unusual energy signature emanating from that orb. Proceed with caution."

  - **Alex Harper**: "I can feel it... It's like it's calling to me. I have to know what it is."

  - **Vela**: "The readings indicate high levels of electromagnetic interference. This could be dangerous."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Dangerous or not, we need answers. Keep monitoring the situation, Vela."

    (Alex approaches the orb, her hand reaching out almost instinctively)

  - **Vela**: "Alex, wait! The energy is spiking—"

    (As Alex touches the orb, a surge of energy courses through her, and her vision distorts. She hears distorted voices and sees fleeting images of the crew's last moments.)

  - **Alex Harper**: "What... what is this? It’s like I can see their memories..."

  - **Vela**: "Alex, the energy appears to be interacting with your neural pathways. It’s downloading information directly into your mind."

  - **Alex Harper**: "I see... the experiments... the crew being corrupted."

  - **Vela**: "You must resist, Alex. The Hive's influence is strong. It’s trying to corrupt you as well."

    (Alex staggers back, fighting against the overwhelming force trying to take hold of her.)

  - **Alex Harper**: "No... I won’t let it. Vela, help me!"

  - **Vela**: "Initiating countermeasures. Stay strong, Alex."

    (With Vela's assistance, Alex manages to break free from the orb's influence, but she feels changed, with new insights and a sense of the impending danger.)

  - **Alex Harper**: "That was too close. But now I know what we’re dealing with. We need to find Dr. Voss and put an end to this."

  - **Vela**: "Agreed. The information you absorbed should help us. Let's move quickly."

Thanks to Vela's intervention, Alex manages to resist the corruption attempt. As the energy dissipates, she gains insight into its true nature – a form of alien technology that was being developed onboard the Prodigium. By absorbing the energy from the orb, Alex gains partial access to the ship's data logs, revealing that the energy is a form of alien computer virus, that called itself “**The Hive**”.

After discovering the true nature of The Hive, Alex is uncertain whom to trust. Vela, while still acting helpful, suggests that she has gathered crucial data on how to defeat The Hive. This data points Alex to various key components scattered throughout the ship.

- Dialogue:

  - **Vela**: "Alex, I've accessed some old logs. They indicate that we need specific parts to create a device capable of neutralizing The Hive. The first component is located in the hangar. We must go there immediately."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Alright, Vela. Lead the way. But this better work; we can't afford any more setbacks."
