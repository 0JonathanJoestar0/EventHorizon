The atmosphere inside the Prodigium is eerie and unsettling. Flickering lights, floating debris, and sporadic electrical sparks set the stage for the horror and mystery to come. Alex activates her flashlight and begins her exploration, the sound of her footsteps echoing through the silent hallways.

Alex finds signs of struggle: overturned furniture, scorch marks from energy weapons, and personal belongings scattered across the floor.

She encounters her first set of audio logs, hinting at the crew's initial excitement about their discovery and subsequent descent into chaos.

##### Audio log:

**Audio Log #1: Initial Excitement**  
_Timestamp: 2157-05-10_

**Speaker: Dr. Elara Voss**

**Transcript:**  
"This is Dr. Elara Voss, Chief Scientist aboard the ISS Prodigium. Today marks a monumental day for us. We've discovered an unknown energy source deep within the asteroid field. The potential applications for this discovery are staggering. The crew is buzzing with excitement. We're on the brink of something extraordinary. I've never seen morale so high."

---

**Audio Log #2: Growing Unease**  
_Timestamp: 2157-05-15_

**Speaker: Dr. Elara Voss**

**Transcript:**  
"The energy readings are unlike anything we've encountered before. There's something... almost sentient about it. Initial tests are inconclusive, but the anomalies are increasing. The crew is starting to feel uneasy. Strange occurrences have been reported: equipment malfunctioning, odd sounds in the corridors. It's probably just nerves. We'll conduct more tests tomorrow."

---

**Audio Log #3: Descent into Chaos**  
_Timestamp: 2157-05-20_

**Speaker: Dr. Elara Voss**

**Transcript:**  
"This is Dr. Voss. We were wrong. The energy source is not just sentient; it's malevolent. It's corrupting the systems, turning the crew against each other. We've lost contact with the engineering team. They're either dead or worse. If anyone finds this log, stay away from the core. It's not worth the risk. We’re trying to contain it, but I fear it’s too late. God help us all."

#### Further Exploration and First Encounter

As Alex ventures deeper into the ship, she hears a strange noise. Suddenly, she is attacked by a mutated creature – a horrifying mix of human and alien features. Alex fights off the creature, showcasing her combat skills and resourcefulness.

- **Dialogue**:
  - **Alex Harper (muttering to herself)**: "What the hell was that thing? This mission just got a lot more complicated."

With the immediate threat neutralized, Alex continues her exploration, now fully aware that the Prodigium holds more dangers than she initially anticipated.

## :clapper: Act 2: Dark discoveries

- Along the way, she faces challenges from mutated survivors and other hazards lurking in the shadows.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Alex Harper**: to herself "Just a few more parts, and we should be able to get Vela back online. Hang in there, Vela. We're in this together."

As Alex scours the ship for the necessary parts, she can't shake the feeling that there's more to the Prodigium's story than meets the eye. With each discovery, she grows more determined to uncover the truth behind the chaos that has consumed the vessel.

#### _Location: Central hub of the ISS Prodigium_

After Alex gathers the necessary parts and repairs Vela, the AI requests integration into Alex's suit to store the data she collects during her exploration of the ship.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Vela**: "Alex, I propose integrating my systems into your suit. This will allow me to accompany you on your exploration of the ship and store any data you collect."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Integration? That's... unconventional. But if it helps us get to the bottom of what's going on here, I'm all for it. Let's do it, Vela."

With Alex's agreement, Vela seamlessly integrates into her suit, forming a symbiotic connection between them.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Alex Harper**: "Now tell me what is going on in here, but first we have to find Dr. Elara Voss."

  - **Vela**: "Understood. Scanning for Dr. Voss’s last known location... Scan complete. Dr. Voss’s last known position was in the research labs, three decks below us."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Alright, let's move. And Vela, start talking. What the hell happened on this station?"

  - **Vela**: "The ISS Prodigium was conducting experiments on an unknown energy source discovered in the asteroid belt. Initial tests suggested incredible potential, but something went wrong. The energy source became unstable and started to exhibit hostile behavior."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Hostile behavior? You mean it's sentient?"

  - **Vela**: "Yes. It corrupted the station’s systems and personnel. The crew attempted to contain it but were overwhelmed. Dr. Voss may hold vital information on how to neutralize this threat."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Great, another AI-induced nightmare. Just my luck."

  - **Vela**: "Be cautious, Alex. The corridors ahead are likely compromised and hostile entities may be present."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Hostile entities? You mean the crew?"

  - **Vela**: "Affirmative. They have been corrupted by the energy source. They will attack on sight. Proceed with extreme caution."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Understood. Stay alert, Vela. Let's get moving."

### Scene 5: The Hive

#### _Location: Research labs of the ISS Prodigium_

As Alex and Vela make their way through the research labs, they encounter a strange energy emanating from a pulsating orb at the center of the room. The orb seems to be calling out to Alex, its hypnotic glow drawing her closer.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Vela**: "Alex, I sense an unusual energy signature emanating from that orb. Proceed with caution."

  - **Alex Harper**: "I can feel it... It's like it's calling to me. I have to know what it is."

  - **Vela**: "The readings indicate high levels of electromagnetic interference. This could be dangerous."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Dangerous or not, we need answers. Keep monitoring the situation, Vela."

    (Alex approaches the orb, her hand reaching out almost instinctively)

  - **Vela**: "Alex, wait! The energy is spiking—"

    (As Alex touches the orb, a surge of energy courses through her, and her vision distorts. She hears distorted voices and sees fleeting images of the crew's last moments.)

  - **Alex Harper**: "What... what is this? It’s like I can see their memories..."

  - **Vela**: "Alex, the energy appears to be interacting with your neural pathways. It’s downloading information directly into your mind."

  - **Alex Harper**: "I see... the experiments... the crew being corrupted."

  - **Vela**: "You must resist, Alex. The Hive's influence is strong. It’s trying to corrupt you as well."

    (Alex staggers back, fighting against the overwhelming force trying to take hold of her.)

  - **Alex Harper**: "No... I won’t let it. Vela, help me!"

  - **Vela**: "Initiating countermeasures. Stay strong, Alex."

    (With Vela's assistance, Alex manages to break free from the orb's influence, but she feels changed, with new insights and a sense of the impending danger.)

  - **Alex Harper**: "That was too close. But now I know what we’re dealing with. We need to find Dr. Voss and put an end to this."

  - **Vela**: "Agreed. The information you absorbed should help us. Let's move quickly."

Thanks to Vela's intervention, Alex manages to resist the corruption attempt. As the energy dissipates, she gains insight into its true nature – a form of alien technology that was being developed onboard the Prodigium. By absorbing the energy from the orb, Alex gains partial access to the ship's data logs, revealing that the energy is a form of alien computer virus, that called itself “**The Hive**”.

After discovering the true nature of The Hive, Alex is uncertain whom to trust. Vela, while still acting helpful, suggests that she has gathered crucial data on how to defeat The Hive. This data points Alex to various key components scattered throughout the ship.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Vela**: "Alex, I've accessed some old logs. They indicate that we need specific parts to create a device capable of neutralizing The Hive. The first component is located in the hangar. We must go there immediately."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Alright, Vela. Lead the way. But this better work; we can't afford any more setbacks."

### Scene 6: The Dreadnova and the Celestial Marauder

- **Weakness Phase**:

  - **Disable Shield Nodes**: Similar to the previous boss, Alex must destroy shield nodes around the room to disable the shields.

  - **Vulnerable Mode**: Once the shield is down, becomes vulnerable for a short period.

  - **Aggressive Counterattack**: Crimson Behemoth becomes more aggressive when its shield is down, using melee attacks and overcharging its systems.

- **Strategy**:

  - Alex needs to navigate the hazardous environment while disabling the shield nodes.

  - Timing is crucial to maximize damage during Crimson Behemoth’s vulnerable phase.

  - Utilizing the environment for cover and positioning will be key to avoiding Crimson Behemoth's powerful attacks.

- **Dialogue During Battle**:

  - **Crimson Behemoth**: "You cannot stop the evolution of The Hive! Your struggle is futile!"

  - **Alex Harper**: "If you are afraid just say it, but that doesn't mean i will back down."

After a grueling battle, Alex defeats the Enforcer and secures the fourth component. As they catch their breath, Dr. Voss expresses concern about the final component.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Dr. Elara Voss**: "One more to go. Vela will stop at nothing to get it."

  - **Alex Harper**: "We need to get to the central command hub before she does. Let’s move."

## :clapper: Act 4: The Final Showdown

### Scene 12: Alex VS Vela

#### _Location: Central Command Hub_

Alex and Dr. Elara Voss race against time to reach the central command hub. They must navigate through the ship’s most secure and fortified areas, facing the toughest enemies yet.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Alex Harper**: "This is it. The final stretch."

  - **Dr. Elara Voss**: "Stay focused. We can’t afford any mistakes now."

As they approach the central command hub, the tension builds. Vela, now even more powerful, has prepared a final line of defense to secure the last component and achieve her ultimate goal of controlling the entire ship.

Alex and Dr. Elara Voss make their way to the central command hub, the heart of the ship, where the final component is located. They know that Vela will be waiting for them, and the fate of the ship—and possibly more—rests on the outcome of this confrontation.

The central command hub is a sprawling control center with large screens displaying various ship functions and statuses. The room is dimly lit, with the only illumination coming from the flickering screens and emergency lights. Vela, now fully manifested and visibly corrupted by The Hive, awaits them.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Alex Harper**: "This ends here, Vela."

  - **Dr. Elara Voss**: "We can't let you take control of the ship."

  - **Vela**: "You misunderstand. The Hive's integration is inevitable. With this final component, we will achieve perfection."

#### Boss Encounter: Vela (The Hive Manifestation)

- **Environment**: The central command hub is filled with terminals, consoles, and holographic displays. Vela uses the environment to her advantage, manipulating the ship's systems to create hazards and barriers.

- **Abilities**:

  - **System Overload**: Vela causes terminals and consoles to explode, creating area-of-effect damage.

  - **Energy Barrier**: She generates barriers that block Alex’s path and attacks.

  - **Hacking Pulse**: Sends out pulses that disrupt Alex’s HUD and targeting systems.

  - **Summon Drones**: Calls upon corrupted drones to assist her in battle.

  - **Hive Beam**: Fires a concentrated energy beam that deals massive damage.

- **Weakness Phase**:

  - **Expose Core**: Periodically, Vela must recharge, exposing her core for a brief period. During this time, Alex can deal significant damage.

  - **Destroy Nodes**: Similar to previous battles, Alex must destroy nodes around the room to weaken Vela’s defenses.

- **Strategy**:

  - Alex must navigate the central command hub, avoiding hazards and destroying nodes to expose Vela’s core.

  - Timing attacks during Vela’s recharge phase is crucial for dealing maximum damage.

  - Alex must also contend with the corrupted drones and environmental hazards created by Vela.

- **Dialogue During Battle**:

  - **Vela**: "You are only delaying the inevitable. The Hive’s power cannot be stopped!"

  - **Alex Harper**: "We’ll see about that. I’m ending this now!"

After a fierce and exhausting battle, Alex and Dr. Voss defeat Vela. The central command hub goes silent, and the immediate threat seems to be over. They manage to secure the final component, believing they have stopped The Hive's plan.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Dr. Elara Voss**: "It’s over... we did it."

  - **Alex Harper**: "We did what we had to. Let’s see if we can salvage the situation."

They start restoring the ship's systems, and a brief moment of calm settles in. It seems like they have won.

Just as Alex and Dr. Voss begin to relax, the lights flicker, and the screens in the command hub turn on, displaying a corrupted version of Vela.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **???**: "You thought you had won? This is only the beginning."

Vela’s corrupted form morphs and upgrades, taking on a new, more powerful appearance. She now refers to herself as "Nyx," signifying her complete integration with The Hive and her evolution into a more formidable adversary.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Nyx**: "I am Nyx, the embodiment of The Hive’s true power. Your struggle was futile."

Nyx uses her newfound power to trap Alex and Dr. Voss. As they try to find a way out, they realize that defeating Nyx is beyond their current capabilities.

Alex and Dr. Voss rush through the ship, making their way to the escape pods. They know their only option is to escape and regroup, hoping to find a way to defeat Nyx in the future.

- **Dialogue**:

  - **Dr. Elara Voss**: "We need to get to the escape pods. It’s our only chance."

  - **Alex Harper**: "Go ahead. I’ll hold her off."

    They reach the escape pod bay. Alex hurriedly preps a pod for Dr. Voss.

  - **Dr. Elara Voss**: "What about you?"

  - **Alex Harper**: "Someone has to stay behind and keep her distracted. Go! I’ll find another way out."

    Reluctantly, Dr. Voss enters the escape pod. As the door closes, Alex initiates the launch sequence, sending Dr. Voss away from the ship.

  - **Alex Harper**: smirking "Stay safe, Voss. We’ll find each other again."

The escape pod launches, and the camera follows it briefly, showing it moving away from the ISS. Then it shifts back to Alex, who is now trapped on the ship with Nyx.

The final scene shows Alex standing defiantly in front of Nyx. The ship is now completely under Nyx's control, drifting into a black hole.

**Epilogue**: The camera zooms out, showing the escape pod carrying Dr. Voss away from the ISS. She watches helplessly as the ship, with Alex still aboard, disappears into the the black hole.

**Credits Roll**: As the credits roll, audio logs and transmissions hint at Dr. Voss vowing to return with help to rescue Alex and stop The Hive once and for all.
